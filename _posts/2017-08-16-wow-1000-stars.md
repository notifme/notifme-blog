I have to admit that I didn't really know what to expect... Being my first open source project, getting more than 1000 stargazers in less than a week exceeded my expectations by far.

I had the feeling that [Notif.me SDK](https://github.com/notifme/notifme-sdk) (a Node.js library to send all kinds of transactional notifications) was going to be useful, but this result doubled my motivation.

## How did we get so many stars?

### 1. Provide value

Well, that's a no-brainer, but a necessary first step before doing anything else.

I recommend you this [excellent post](https://linux-audit.com/how-to-promote-your-open-source-project/) by Michael Boelen on the subject.

### 2. Great documentation

We spent two full days to polish our (yet incomplete) documentation on GitHub. We saw that step as if we were launching a startup and working on its homepage. People will only give you a few seconds of attention (just like any other site), make the best of it.

### 3. Share on the right channels

Channels are not all equal, our post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14989214) brought us 20 times more people than Reddit. That created a momentum allowing us to appear very high in [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending) for a few days.

## Conclusion

There you go, this is our story so far, [stay tuned](https://twitter.com/notif_me) for the next episode :)

Given the success of the project, we [created a Slack](https://slackin-notifme.now.sh/) where you can come and discuss what feature would be awesome.
